          <li>Your user ID and role at the time of submission</li>
          <li>When it was created, edited, and published</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>1.4 Cookies & similar technologies</h3>
        <p>
          We may use cookies or similar technologies to:

        <h2>3. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h2>
        <p>
          Where required by law (such as in the EU/EEA or UK), our processing of personal
          data may be based on:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">

        <p>
          We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in limited cases:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers:</strong> With trusted vendors (e.g. hosting, databases,

            safeguards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Team & editors:</strong> With authorized team members and editors who need
            access to operate the platform, review submissions, and enforce policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal & safety:</strong> If required by law or in response to valid legal
            requests, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of OneMarket, our users,
            or the public.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition,
            investment, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of the
            transaction, subject to similar protections.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with
          legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may retain logs and contribution history for longer periods to preserve
          editorial transparency, security records, and auditability, especially for
          published content and trust decisions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information,
          including secure hosting, access controls, and encryption provided by our
          infrastructure and authentication providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          No system is perfectly secure. You are responsible for using a strong password,
          keeping it confidential, and promptly notifying us of any suspected compromise.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>7. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data,

          believe a child has provided us with personal data, contact us and we will take
          appropriate steps to remove it.
