          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of OneMarket News
          ("OneMarket", "we", "us", or "our"), including our website, tools, feeds, dashboards,
          and related services (collectively, the "Service").
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not
          agree, do not use OneMarket.
        </p>
        <p class="text-[0.7rem] text-slate-400">
          This document is a concise, product-ready summary. You may wish to have counsel review
          and adapt it for your specific jurisdiction and business structure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>1. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use
          the Service. To access certain features (such as contributor tools, editor dashboards,
          or admin analytics), you must create an account and provide accurate, current
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
          <li>All activity that occurs under your account.</li>
          <li>Promptly notifying us of any unauthorized access or suspected compromise.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>2. Roles & Access Levels</h2>
        <p>
          OneMarket may assign roles to accounts, including (for example) reader, writer,
          editor, and admin. Each role has different permissions inside the platform.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Readers</strong> may view public content and manage their profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Writers</strong> may submit stories and manage their own submissions.</li>
          <li><strong>Editors</strong> may review, edit, label, and approve content.</li>
          <li><strong>Admins</strong> may manage roles, sources, settings, and internal tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may modify, revoke, or review your role or access at any time if we believe it is
          necessary to protect the Service, users, or partners.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>3. Content & Submissions</h2>
        <p>
          The Service includes curated news items, links, summaries, analyses, and user
          submissions (collectively, "Content"). Content may be created by OneMarket, by
          contributors, or ingested from external sources.
        </p>
        <h3>3.1 Your submissions</h3>
        <p>
          If you submit or publish content via OneMarket (including headlines, summaries,
          commentary, or links), you:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Represent that you have the right to share it.</li>
          <li>Agree not to infringe any third-party rights or applicable laws.</li>
          <li>Grant OneMarket a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display,
              adapt, and distribute that content in connection with the Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may edit, feature, de-rank, fact-check, annotate, or remove submissions at our
          discretion, particularly for accuracy, clarity, or policy compliance.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 No guaranteed publication</h3>
        <p>
          Submission does not guarantee inclusion in the public feed. Editors and automated
          systems may decline, delay, or request changes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>4. Trust Labels, Scores & Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          OneMarket displays trust labels, scores, and metadata to help users evaluate stories
          and sources. These indicators are best-effort, opinionated assessments based on our
          methodology and tools; they are not certifications, warranties, or guarantees.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update our methodology over time. A story’s trust score or label may change as
          new information emerges.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Uploading or promoting defamatory, fraudulent, or misleading information.</li>
          <li>Coordinated manipulation of markets, assets, or public sentiment.</li>
          <li>Attempting to bypass security, rate limits, or access controls.</li>
          <li>Reverse engineering or scraping the Service beyond what is permitted by robots rules or documented APIs.</li>
          <li>Harassing, abusing, or doxxing other users or individuals.</li>
          <li>Submitting content that is hateful, illegal, or violates applicable regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate accounts, remove content, or take other action if we
          believe these Terms or applicable laws are violated.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Links & Sources</h2>
        <p>
          The Service links out to third-party sites, documents, filings, APIs, and social
          posts. These are provided for reference and convenience.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          OneMarket does not control and is not responsible for the content, accuracy,
          security, or policies of third-party properties. Access them at your own discretion.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>7. No Investment or Legal Advice</h2>
        <p>
          OneMarket is an information product, not an advisor.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Nothing on the Service is an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to buy or sell securities or digital assets.</li>
          <li>Nothing on the Service is legal, tax, or financial advice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for decisions made using information from OneMarket.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The OneMarket brand, design, code, and original content are owned by OneMarket News,
          LLC or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as expressly allowed (e.g. via documented APIs or share links), you may not
          reproduce, distribute, or commercialize substantial parts of the Service without
          prior written permission.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to some or all of the Service at any time,
          with or without notice, if we believe it is necessary to protect the platform,
          comply with law, or enforce these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may stop using the Service at any time. Some rights and obligations (including
          licenses granted, disclaimers, and limitations of liability) survive termination.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of
          any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to accuracy,
          reliability, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation, nor that the Service will
          always be up to date or free from vulnerabilities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, OneMarket and its owners, team members,
          and partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
          or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or opportunities arising from your
          use of (or inability to use) the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where liability cannot be excluded, it is limited to the amount you paid (if any) for
          access to the Service in the 3 months preceding the claim.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last
          updated" date above. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect
          constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>13. Contact</h2>
